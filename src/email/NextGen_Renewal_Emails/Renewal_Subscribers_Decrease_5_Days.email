Please note that in five days, the number of seats on this opportunity will be reduced. As your recent renewal is for a smaller number of seats than the original subscription, you will need to remove the extra users. This can be done by going to the new Subscription NG page and changing the Subscriber End Date of the affected users so that their access ends on the same date of the original subscription.
