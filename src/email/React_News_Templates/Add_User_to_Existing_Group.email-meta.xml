    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.SuppliedName},

We have sent you an introduction email – from there you should be able to set up your account, interests, and preferences, and access our content.

Once login credentials are set up, you can also access the React Deal Tracker on our website and mobile app. A 2-minute promotional video that may be of interest as well as the links to download this on the App Store or Google Play can be found here:  https://www.reactnews.media/deal-tracker/
