<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Hey {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</span></font><br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12px;">I hope you enjoyed the long weekend. I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we are now publishing a "Tools &amp; Tips" report at Green Street. The goal of this report is to reference outside news headlines&nbsp;and then demonstrate how users can explore Green Street's platform to become better informed on the topics discussed in the referenced article. This is not a report that contains additional insights or opinions on the article's topic, rather a representation of how Green Street's users can navigate the platform to dive deeper on said topic. I have attached the most recent Tools &amp; Tips report. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.</span></font><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Thanks,<br />
<br />
Dan</span></span><br />
