We write to address the past due payment owed to Green Street Advisors, LLC (“Green Street’) pursuant to the agreement between {{{Transaction__c.Account__c}}} and Green Street dated and signed on {{{Transaction__c.Invoice_Due_Date__c}}}, a copy of which is attached. Payment is due within 30 days of invoicing under the Agreement. As you will recall, we rendered Invoice #{{{Transaction__c.Name}}} on {{{Transaction__c.Invoice_Due_Date__c}}} but have not received full payment. The invoice # {{{Transaction__c.Name}}} <b>is now </b>{{{Transaction__c.Days_Overdue__c}}}<b> days past due</b>. Your prompt payment is required to avoid a disruption of service. Please send payment remittance details to <a href="mailto:accountsreceivable@greenstreet.com" target="_blank">accountsreceivable@greenstreet.com</a>.<br />
<br />
