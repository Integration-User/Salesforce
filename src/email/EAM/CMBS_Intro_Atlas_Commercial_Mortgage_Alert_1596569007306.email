Green Street, if you don't recall, provides research and data around Commercial Real Estate both in the public and private markets.<br /> <br /> Recently, Green Street has created a new product called Atlas which helps debt managers like yourself evaluate private market real estate valuations.&nbsp; Additionally, Green Street has&nbsp;recently acquired Commercial Mortgage Alert which provides new news around the CMBS industry.<br /> <br /> I was wondering if you are free for a quick introduction call so I can learn a bit more about Putnam's fixed income focus around instruments related to CRE.&nbsp; I'm free all next week and can work around your availability.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> <br /> Eric<br /> <br /> Eric Lovett<br /> <span style="color:black">VP Institutional Sales</span><br /> <b><span style="color:green">Green Street Advisors</span></b><br /> <span style="color:black">2828 N.
