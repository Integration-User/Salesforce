  <span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> My name is Eric Lovett, and I am the new sales coverage for your firm. I was wondering if I could get your latest analyst coverage list?&nbsp; Also, could I send you a list of users that you could audit? We want to make sure we have people that should be receiving research getting what they need, and also removing anyone no longer at the firm.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> <br /> Eric<br /> <br /> Eric Lovett<br /> <span style="color:black">VP Institutional Sales</span><br /> <b><span style="color:green">Green Street Advisors</span></b><br /> <span style="color:black">2828 N.
