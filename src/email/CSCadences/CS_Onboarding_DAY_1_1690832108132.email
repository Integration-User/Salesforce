<p>Hey&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>Welcome to Green Street!&nbsp;{{{Recipient.OwnerId}}} &nbsp;and I would like to schedule time to give you a quick overview of the Green Street platform. In the training, we will go over all the products/tools included in your subscription, dive deeper into specific areas of interest, as well as answer any questions you may have.</p>

<p>We encourage you to invite the rest of your team to attend the training as well so we can help get them set up with the platform and using the tools. If there are any scheduling conflicts for team members, we are happy to schedule separate sessions to accommodate.</p>

<p>Please let us know when you prefer to meet and I can send over a calendar invite. If you can please distribute that invite internally to the broader group, that would be much appreciated. Looking forward to connecting!</p>

<p>Regards,<br />
