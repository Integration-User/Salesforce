<p>Hey {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're excited that youâ€™re on your way as a valued client of Green Street. I wanted to check in and see how your experience is going so far and offer my assistance if needed. If you have any inquiries, I am more than happy to work through them with you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, we would be happy to set up another session on a specific Green Street product. This can look like a deep dive on a particular area of the platform that you are unfamiliar with/have questions on or integration with DataLink. Please let me know if this is of interest to you and I would be happy to get something in the calendar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best,&nbsp;<br />
