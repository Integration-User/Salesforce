<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>

<p>Checking in to see if there are any additional members of your team that could benefit from having access to Green Street’s <a href="https://my.greenstreet.com/news/all/publications" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">News</a>, <a href="https://my.greenstreet.com/research-library?region=NA&amp;reportId=16567" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Research</a>, and <a href="https://my.greenstreet.com/data-analytics/other/rankings?rankingType=1&amp;year=2022" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Data Tools</a> included in your subscription.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your account does not have a limit on the number of users, so the more the merrier! Once we determine which additional colleagues to add to the subscription, it’s a quick turn around to get their accounts activated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We would be happy to schedule additional trainings for any new or current users who might have missed the initial training session or have follow up questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is of interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best,<br />
{{{Sender.Signature}}}</p>
