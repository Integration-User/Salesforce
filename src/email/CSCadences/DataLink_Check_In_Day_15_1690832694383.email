<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hey {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope all is well. In addition to the research platform that Green Street offers, we also have the ability to integrate our data into an Excel plug-in called DataLink, which allows you to power your models with easily downloadable Green Street data.â€¯&nbsp;<br />
<br />
DataLink:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
DataLink is an Excel add-in tool that will allow you to create refreshable models, access pre-built templates, and pull Green Street data more quickly and efficiently, rather than having to pull data manually from our website. To help manage your analysis, you can access current and historical (when applicable) macro, sector, company, and geographic market data.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For more information &amp; instructions to install the plug-in, please click <a href="https://my.greenstreet.com/datalink" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
Let me know if any additional questions come up. More than happy to hop on a call to help you get acquainted.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best,&nbsp;<br />
