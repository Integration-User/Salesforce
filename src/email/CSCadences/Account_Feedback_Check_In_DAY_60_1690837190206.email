<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope all is well. It’s been a few months since your Green Street account was activated and I wanted to check in to see how you’re enjoying the platform. Do you have a few minutes to chat later this week or next? Part of my role on Customer Success is to get feedback from clients on our products so that we can bring that to our Product team internally to make relevant enhancements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let me know when you have ~15 minutes to chat and I’ll send over an invite. Looking forward to connecting and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks,&nbsp;<br />
